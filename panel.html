                  At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered
                  the room in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that
                  her carriage was waiting. She wrung her hands in mock despair.
                  "How annoying!" she cried. "I must go. I have to call for my
                  husband at the club, to take him to some absurd meeting at
                  Willis's Rooms, where he is going to be in the chair. If I am
                  late he is sure to be furious, and I couldn't have a scene in
                  this bonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh word would ruin
                  it. No, I must go, dear Agatha. Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are
                  quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing. I am sure I
                  don't know what to say about your views. You must come and
                  dine with us some night. Tuesday? Are you disengaged Tuesday?"
                  "For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess," said Lord Henry
                  with a bow. "Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you,"
                  she cried; "so mind you come"; and she swept out of the room,
                  followed by Lady Agatha and the other ladies. When Lord Henry
                  had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking a
                  chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm. "You talk
                  books away," he said; "why don't you write one?" "I am too
                  fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine. I
                  should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be
                  as lovely as a Persian carpet and as unreal. But there is no
                  literary public in England for anything except newspapers,
                  primers, and encyclopaedias. Of all people in the world the
                  English have the least sense of the beauty of literature." "I
                  fear you are right," answered Mr. Erskine. "I myself used to
                  have literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now,
                  my dear young friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may
                  I ask if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch?"
                  "I quite forget what I said," smiled Lord Henry. "Was it all
                  very bad?" "Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely
                  dangerous, and if anything happens to our good duchess, we
                  shall all look on you as being primarily responsible. But I
                  should like to talk to you about life. The generation into
                  which I was born was tedious. Some day, when you are tired of
                  London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your
                  philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am
                  fortunate enough to possess." "I shall be charmed. A visit to
                  Treadley would be a great privilege. It has a perfect host,
                  and a perfect library." "You will complete it," answered the
                  old gentleman with a courteous bow. "And now I must bid
                  good-bye to your excellent aunt. I am due at the Athenaeum. It
                  is the hour when we sleep there." "All of you, Mr. Erskine?"
                  "Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an
                  English Academy of Letters." Lord Henry laughed and rose. "I
                  am going to the park," he cried. As he was passing out of the
                  door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm. "Let me come with
                  you," he murmured. "But I thought you had promised Basil
                  Hallward to go and see him," answered Lord Henry.

                  My surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight
                  in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew
                  that I was still unclean. 5 October.--We all rose early, and I
                  think that sleep did much for each and all of us. When we met
                  at early breakfast there was more general cheerfulness than
                  any of us had ever expected to experience again. It is really
                  wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let
                  any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any
                  way--even by death--and we fly back to first principles of
                  hope and enjoyment. More than once as we sat around the table,
                  my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days
                  had not been a dream. It was only when I caught sight of the
                  red blotch on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I was brought back
                  to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the matter,
                  it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our
                  trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose
                  sight of her trouble for whole spells; it is only now and
                  again, when something recalls it to her mind, that she thinks
                  of her terrible scar. We are to meet here in my study in half
                  an hour and decide on our course of action. I see only one
                  immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather than
                  reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear
                  that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied.
                  I know that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all
                  that has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must
                  be; but she will not, or cannot, give them utterance. I have
                  mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it
                  over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of that horrid
                  poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The
                  Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing
                  called "the Vampire's baptism of blood." Well, there may be a
                  poison that distils itself out of good things; in an age when
                  the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder
                  at anything! One thing I know: that if my instinct be true
                  regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, then there is a
                  terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us.
                  The same power that compels her silence may compel her speech.
                  I dare not think further; for so I should in my thoughts
                  dishonour a noble woman! Van Helsing is coming to my study a
                  little before the others. I shall try to open the subject with
                  him. Later.--When the Professor came in, we talked over the
                  state of things. I could see that he had something on his mind
                  which he wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about
                  broaching the subject. After beating about the bush a little,
                  he said suddenly:-- "Friend John, there is something that you
                  and I must talk of alone, just at the first at any rate.
                  Later, we may have to take the others into our confidence";
                  then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--
